Pion saw its first commit Wed Mar 7 2018. I didn't have grand aspirations
for the project. It just felt important at the time to make WebRTC more
accessible. Proprietary alternatives were being proposed and they
didn't have technical advantages, they were just easier to use.
I enjoyed solving issues one at a time and helping users
use the software.

Interest in WebRTC then exploded in 2020. Lots of new demand for WebRTC
software popped up over night. New developers started learning it,
companies were founded around it and lots of VC money started entering
the space.

I was approached by a few VCs about doing something commercial with Pion.
It sounded exciting and I would have been fun to work on Pion full-time.
In the end I decided that it would benefit me personally, but would be a
net negative. These are the reasons I decided against it.

### Reduce opportunities for individuals

Working on Open Source early in my career had a huge impact on me, and I
hope that working on Pion can do the same for others. A few milestones that
mean a lot to me.

* First job in video because of a project they built with Pion.
* First speaking opportunity talking about a Pion contribution.
* Company that uses Pion hiring multiple contributors and doubling their salaries.
* A contributor that is an expert in RTC returning to the field through Pion

If Pion was for profit I don't think I could create an environment where this would
all be happening. I can focus on giving individuals the best outcome and not worry about
a business.

### Harder to be a community

For me Pion isn't just software, but a community to build things with
others who are passionate. I love seeing all the projects that people
share in [Slack](https://pion.ly/slack). I remember lots of late night
debugging sessions and difficult bugs overcome. I remember the excitement
when [WebRTC for the Curious](https://webrtcforthecurious.com) first started.

I don't think those relationships would have been made if Pion was a for profit
project. I would have to prioritize issues effecting the business. I want to create
an environment where developers can pour their passion into problems that interest them.

### Competition with contributors and users

I enjoy having an open discourse with the companies and projects that use Pion. I love
learning about what people are building and learning from them. I am filled with so
much joy seeing all the different use cases.

* [Robotics](https://formant.io/) - Makes it possible to build robots that make hospitals safer.
* [Cloud Ready WebRTC](https://livekit.io) - Making it so any company to build and scale WebRTC
* [Low/No-Code WebRTC](https://www.100ms.live/) - Empowering the next generation of builders so they don't need to learn the details.
* [Application Streaming](https://neverinstall.com/) - Users who can't afford the latest hardware can still access everything.
* [Collaborative Gaming](https://piepacker.com/) - Multiplayer NES in the browser, don't let distance stop you from spending time together.
* [P2P CDN](https://strivecast.com/p2p-sdk/) - Reduce network strain by sharing what you have already downloaded. Bringing P2P to everyone!


This is just the start of it. I have learned so much from watching the projects and companies [Using Pion](https://github.com/pion/awesome-pion) grow.
If I started building competing software I would lose out on learning all these stories.

### Less diverse contributions

If I worked on Pion full-time more issues would be addressed by me directly.
I am not sure this would be better for the project long term. Pionâ€™s growth and
quality is because we have so many contributors who bring a wide variety of opinions
and experiences.

Things like WASM Support, ORTC and Interceptors came from designs by other developers.
If I had done everything myself I don't believe it would be nearly as good.

### Divide between employees/community

All community members are equal in the Pion ecosystem. Each developer only
needs one approval to merge their PR. I don't ever want there to be a
split. Employees of 'Pion Inc' would be viewed differently and would have access
to resources others wouldn't have.

It is important to me that Pion is welcoming and inclusive to all.
